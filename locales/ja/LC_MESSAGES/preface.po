"Static program analysis is the art of reasoning about the behavior of "
"computer programs without actually running them. This is useful not only "
"in optimizing compilers for producing efficient code but also for "
"automatic error detection and other tools that can help programmers. A "
"static program analyzer is a program that reasons about the behavior of "
"other programs. For anyone interested in programming, what can be more "
"fun than writing programs that analyze programs?"

"As known from Turing and Rice, all nontrivial properties of the behavior "
"of programs written in common programming languages are mathematically "
"undecidable. This means that automated reasoning of software generally "
"must involve approximation. It is also well known that testing, i.e. "
"concretely running programs and inspecting the output, may reveal errors "
"but generally cannot show their absence. In contrast, static program "
"analysis can – with the right kind of approximations – check all possible"
" executions of the programs and provide guarantees about their "
"properties. One of the key challenges when developing such analyses is "
"how to ensure high precision and efficiency to be practically useful. For"
" example, nobody will use an analysis designed for bug finding if it "
"reports many false positives or if it is too slow to fit into real-world "
"software development processes."

"These notes present principles and applications of static analysis of "
"programs. We cover basic type analysis, lattice theory, control flow "
"graphs, dataflow analysis, fixed-point algorithms, widening and "
"narrowing, path sensitivity, relational analysis, interprocedural "
"analysis, context sensitivity, control-flow analysis, several flavors of "
"pointer analysis, and key concepts of semantics-based abstract "
"interpretation. A tiny imperative programming language with pointers and "
"first-class functions is subjected to numerous different static analyses "
"illustrating the techniques that are presented. We take a *constraint-"
"based approach* to static analysis where suitable constraint systems "
"conceptually divide the analysis task into a front-end that generates "
"constraints from program code and a back-end that solves the constraints "
"to produce the analysis results. This approach enables separating the "
"analysis specification, which determines its precision, from the "
"algorithmic aspects that are important for its performance. In practice "
"when implementing analyses, we often solve the constraints on-the-fly, as"
" they are generated, without representing them explicitly."

"We focus on analyses that are fully automatic (i.e., not involving "
"programmer guidance, for example in the form of loop invariants or type "
"annotations) and conservative (sound but incomplete), and we only "
"consider Turing complete languages (like most programming languages used "
"in ordinary software development)."
